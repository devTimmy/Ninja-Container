# Introduction
Ninja Container is a simple inversion of control container developed by one guy who wishes other developers to come in and help in shaping and testing the code. It is fully open source and therefore anyone
can use in their software. Currently, this version of the container powers a couple of software projects developed by the creator of this as well. In short, I cannot guarantee a 100% confidence level to use
this container in Production since it has not been thoroughly tested.
